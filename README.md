# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent graduate of Dickinson College who double majored in math and computer science.  

This Github holds a few repositories of different work I have done. In recent years I worked largely as product manager for a small medical marketplace solution called [DocMe.Health](https://docme.health/). Before DocMe I also worked developing web based analytics platforms for different companies such as HP and United Health Group.

Some of my favorite technologies I use are:
- React.js
- Node.js
- Python
- Java  

Feel Free to reach me at Benjamin.c.cross@gmail.com  

Bonus FunFact: I have climbed two of the seven summits, one of which is the tallest mountain outside asia.
